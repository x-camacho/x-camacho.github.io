## About this project ##
The intention of this program is to name and level-up a pet plant using several methods to keep it happy.  Methods include - "Sun", "Water", and "Love".  Failing to keep your plant happy during their "will to live" timeframe can end in the hypothetical death of your pet plant.  The user will be allowed to start the game over again and level-up their pet as many times as they wish.  

## Why the project is useful ##
The user will find this program as a useful general time waster, but as the developer of this program - this project served as a wealth of learning opportunities.  I am grateful for the opportunity to conceptualize, build, and expand on this project. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript as the primary languages for this project enabled me to deploy concepts learned in class.  

## User Story ##
As a potential user of this program, I want to be able to name my potential pet plant and level it up.  Users will be able to enter a name for their plant via a form on the third user screen.  

Once users name their plant, they will be able to interact with their pet plant.  Users will be able select from three different feeding methods that will fill thier pet's happiness meter. 

Users will find that keeping their pet plants happy will increasse the happiness meter until they trigger a level-up.  Leveling-up dons you a new title every subsequent level that is achieved.

If users fail to keep their pet plant happy during the allotted timeframe, their pet will lose the will to live.  If a users pet plant dies, they will have the option of re-rolling thier pet plant to engage in the game once more.

## Unresolved Issues and Bugs ##
Code repeats itself and there are numerous unecessary functions that can be refactored.  Additionally, the buttons will at times bug out and cooldowns will not activate or only activate for a shorter duration of the setTimeout() interval. The game works, but their are opportunities to make the code clean and fast.  

Additionally, there is technically no "win" condition, levels will continue and more titles will be needed as the levels increase.
